# My-Playlist-Project-Spotify-Clone-

This is a spotify clone project in which I have added my favourite ten songs and with the help of HTML, CSS, JSS I have composed them in one single playlist.

# How to install-
If you want to run it in your laptop/computer then Visual Studio Code or any other editor(Visual Studio Code is recommended) must be installed.
You have to simply git clone the project and save it in the folder of your choice.

# How To Run-
Just open the folder in Visual Studio Code and then enjoy your playlist by simply opening in the live server.

NOTE: You can modify the project and can add more or less number of songs. These songs are my one of the favourites, you can add your favourite songs.
